After examining the data, I realized that it is possible to infer a person's smoking type based on their sociodemographic situation, personality traits, and lifestyle factors. To achieve this, I preprocessed the dataset by cleaning and engineering features, such as mapping categorical variables to numerical formats.

I then utilized machine learning models, including a Neural Network and a Random Forest classifier, to predict the smoking type of individuals. These models were combined using a Stacking Classifier to leverage the strengths of both algorithms.
